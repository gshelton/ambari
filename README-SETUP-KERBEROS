Steps to setup Kerberos authentication using a shell script.

1. Clone repository to your local/one of the node in the cluster

git clone https://github.com/gshelton/kerberos-setup.git

2. cd to useful-scripts/ambari/

3. Copy setup_kerberos.sh and ambari.props to the host which you want to setup as KDC Server

4. Please keep setup_kerberos.sh and ambari.props at the same location

5. Edit ambari.props and modify as per your requirements

6. Start installation by simply executing setup_kerberos.sh

e.g. sh setup_kerberos.sh

Notes:

1. Please run setup_kerberos.sh from KDC_HOST only, you don't need to setup or configure KDC, this script will do everything for you.

2. If you are running script on Sandbox then please turn OFF maintenance mode for HDFS and turn ON maintenance mode for Zeppelin Notebook before executing the script.
